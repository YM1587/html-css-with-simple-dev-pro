<!-- HTML:HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE;a tool used to create wensites -->
<!-- Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed to be 
 displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies
  such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia 
web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as 
interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by 
denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. 
HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img> and <input> directly introduce
 content into the page. Other tags such as <p> and </p> surround and provide information about document text and may 
 include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of
 web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former 
 maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit 
 presentational HTML since 1997.[3] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily
  using the <canvas> element, together with JavaScript. -->

<!-- HTML elements are the fundamental building blocks of web pages, defining the structure and content of a document. 
 They are created using tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets (<>) and often come in pairs (start and end tags). 
 Elements can represent various types of content, like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.  -->

 <!-- Key aspects of HTML elements:
Structure:
An element typically consists of a start tag, optional content (text, other elements), and an end tag. 
Tags:
HTML elements are defined by tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets (<>). The start tag marks the beginning of the 
element, and the end tag (if present) marks the end. 
Content:
Elements can contain text, other elements, or even be void (containing no content and only a start tag). 
Attributes:
Elements can have attributes that provide additional information about the element (e.g., href for links, src for images). 
Types:
HTML elements can be broadly categorized into: 
Normal elements: Have both a start and end tag (e.g., <p>), but some end tags can be omitted. 
Raw text elements: Elements that can contain raw text without any interpretation (e.g., <pre>). 
Void elements: Elements that only have a start tag and no content (e.g., <img>, <br>). 
Examples:
Common HTML elements include headings (<h1>, <h2>, etc.), paragraphs (<p>), links (<a>), images (<img>), lists (<ul>, 
    <ol>, <li>), and divs (<div>). 
Semantic elements:
Newer HTML5 elements (like <header>, <article>, <nav>, etc.) provide more semantic meaning, making it easier for search 
    engines and developers to understand the structure of a page.  -->
