<!-- HTML:HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE;a tool used to create wensites -->
<!-- Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed to be 
 displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies
  such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia 
web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as 
interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by 
denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. 
HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img> and <input> directly introduce
 content into the page. Other tags such as <p> and </p> surround and provide information about document text and may 
 include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of
 web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former 
 maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit 
 presentational HTML since 1997.[3] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily
  using the <canvas> element, together with JavaScript. -->

<!-- HTML elements are the fundamental building blocks of web pages, defining the structure and content of a document. 
 They are created using tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets (<>) and often come in pairs (start and end tags). 
 Elements can represent various types of content, like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.  -->

 <!-- Key aspects of HTML elements:
Structure:
An element typically consists of a start tag, optional content (text, other elements), and an end tag. 
Tags:
HTML elements are defined by tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets (<>). The start tag marks the beginning of the 
element, and the end tag (if present) marks the end. 
Content:
Elements can contain text, other elements, or even be void (containing no content and only a start tag). 
Attributes:
Elements can have attributes that provide additional information about the element (e.g., href for links, src for images). 
Types:
HTML elements can be broadly categorized into: 
Normal elements: Have both a start and end tag (e.g., <p>), but some end tags can be omitted. 
Raw text elements: Elements that can contain raw text without any interpretation (e.g., <pre>). 
Void elements: Elements that only have a start tag and no content (e.g., <img>, <br>). 
Examples:
Common HTML elements include headings (<h1>, <h2>, etc.), paragraphs (<p>), links (<a>), images (<img>), lists (<ul>, 
    <ol>, <li>), and divs (<div>). 
Semantic elements:
Newer HTML5 elements (like <header>, <article>, <nav>, etc.) provide more semantic meaning, making it easier for search 
    engines and developers to understand the structure of a page.  -->

    <!-- HTML TAGS ,ATTRIBUTES ,NAMES AND VALUES:In HTML, tag attributes are used to provide additional information about 
     an HTML element. They consist of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign. Attributes are typically placed 
     within the opening tag of an HTML element. Some attributes, like "id" and "class," are used for styling or 
     identifying elements, while others, like "src" for images or "href" for links, define the source or destination of 
     the element. 
Elaboration:
Attribute Name:
The attribute name is a string that identifies the attribute, such as "src," "href," "class," or "id". 
Attribute Value:
The value associated with an attribute can be a string, a boolean (true or false), or a number, depending on the specific 
attribute and element. 
Purpose:
Attributes provide extra information about an element, allowing for customization, functionality, and styling. For
 example:
id: Used to uniquely identify an element on the page, allowing for targeting with JavaScript or CSS. 
class: Used to group elements together for applying the same styles. 
src: Specifies the source file for an image, video, or audio. 
href: Specifies the destination URL for a hyperlink. 
title: Provides additional information about an element, often displayed as a tooltip. 
Examples:
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example</a>
<p class="paragraph" id="main-paragraph">This is a paragraph.</p>
Boolean Attributes:
Some attributes, like required, readonly, and checked, don't need a value. Their presence in the tag automatically 
applies the attribute to the element. 
<input type="text" required> -->

<!-- CSS:Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a 
 document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[2] CSS
  is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[3]

CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[4] 
This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation;
 provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to 
 share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the
  structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share 
  the file and its formatting.

Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for 
different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on
 Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternative formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile
  device.[5]

The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which declaration applies if more than one 
declaration of a property match a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css 
is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.
[6]

In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS is
 also used in the GTK widget toolkit. -->

 <!-- A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.

CSS Syntax
CSS selector

The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are 
surrounded by curly braces. -->
<!-- 1. Separation of Content and Presentation; Classes help keep the content separate from the styling in HTML making the code more organized and easier to maintain.
